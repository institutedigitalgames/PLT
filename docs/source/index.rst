PLT Documentation
=================

Preference learning (PL) is a core area of machine learning that handles datasets with ordinal relations. As the
number of generated data of ordinal nature such as ranks and subjective ratings is increasing, the importance and
role of the PL field becomes central within machine learning research and practice.

The Preference Learning Toolbox (PLT) is an open source software application and package which supports the key
data modelling phases incorporating various popular data pre-processing, feature selection and preference
learning methods.
